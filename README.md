## IMPORTANT STUFF

This mod contains a collection of patches from various sources (all MIT/GNU GPL licensed sources) in order to bring you the best collection of QOL and tweaks in one spot


# Changelog (latest patch listed first)
##### 0.6.0
* Compile against latest game version
	* Fix issues with the save data paths after patch.
  * Toggle the new modded variable.
##### 0.5.2
* Update Signs Code
	* Cache default material for sign text before modifications so we can swap back to vanilla at anytime.
  * Rich text being on/off now dictates vanilla or custom colors. (Rich text must be on for default color to work, otherwise it's vanilla color.)
##### 0.5.1
* PR from Blaxxun
	* Fix version check when installed with other mods that do it similarly.
##### 0.5.0
* Update Signs Code
	* Add config to change deafult color of signs
	* Change default font setting to actual default font from game. (Not sure why it wasn't to start)
	* Note: Default color is a string like "red" or "black". It doesn't touch signs that have already been changed by richtext markup. (a.k.a. <color=red></color>)
* Update ServerSync version internally
* Update dependency strings in manifest.json
* Update readme's features listing
##### 0.4.11
* Took PR from Azumatt

##### 0.3.7
* MapDetails and ShowContainer contents updated
##### 0.3.6

##### 0.3.5
* Update stamina drain values to be vanilla defaults. Note: They are direct drain values, not percent, some people were asking about that.
##### 0.3.3
* Added our name to the version string check, not just the version number.
* Addition of the Connection Panel configuration. You can now add servers to the Join Game menu on the main screen. Examples provided; Option is off by default.
  * These should be separated by commas! This option is client side only, they load right before the main menu shows.
  * The previous hard coded values were removed, it was felt that it should be a configurable option if you choose to use it like we did.
##### 0.3.2
  * Fix UI bug with QuickSlots (Thank you Metr√©u and ZurielRedux for reporting it!)
    * It is highly recommended that you regenerate your configuration file!! (Delete the old one and reboot the server or client with the new DLL loaded)
##### 0.3.1
  * Fix crashing bug
##### 0.3.0
  * Fix a *really* weird issue with RRR compatibility. This should fix the "Unable to find prefab" issues with this mod and RRR.
  * Added more information to the configs to help you tell what is synced with server and what is not.
  * Change some configs to be actual KeyCodes and not the string values for extra quality of life in configuring the mod
